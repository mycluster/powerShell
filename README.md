# powerShell
This repository contains scripts used to create a more efficient lab manipulation and removes the need to log into each lab computer to install software/custom manage folder creations<br><br>

* VMPS stands for Virtual Machine Push Service, and uses powershell to push out a directory to multiple networks across the networks <br>
* VMPS will also remove folders remotely and restart each computer if needed for complete install.
